**Task**:  
Build a simple weather app using React.

**App requirements (minimal functionality)**:  
1. Utilize data from any open weather API ([metaweather.com](http://metaweather.com/), OpenWeatherMap or any other you like).  
1. Implement an input field for searching for a city to display the forecast for.  
1. Display forecast for the upcoming 3 days - including max/min temperature, weather state (cloudy/rainy/sunny etc.), wind speed.  
1. Use browser geolocation to set the default location when a user first enters the app.  
1. Implement a toggle to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
1. Remember the last selected location between browser sessions in local storage.  
1. Handle API errors and missing data gracefully.  
1. Add unit tests for the most crucial components and utilities.

**What will we be looking at**:  
1. Code structure and quality.  
1. Compliance with the requirements.

 **Additional info**:  
1. Pick JavaScript or TypeScript - whatever you feel more comfortable with.  
1. You can use any library you see fit. There are no additional points for writing code that can be easily replaced by a well-tested and actively maintained library.  
1. Feel free to use any project bootstrapper you like (CRA, Gatsby, Next.js, Redwood.js or anything else).  
1. As for the UI - it does not have to be visually stunning, but please keep it tidy and intuitive. Use whatever UI library or CSS framework you like. Making it work nicely on mobile and desktop resolutions would be a plus.  
1. It will be tested on the latest Firefox.  
1. If anything is missing from the description and you're in doubt - use your best guess, but also do not hesitate to contact us if you prefer.
